The technical background of the lead artists will be utilized as a means of support for all participating artists wishing to integrate electronics and kinetic components to their practice.</p><h4>Curated Vending Machines</h4><p>Alongside the main works, all participants are invited to submit artworks for the various vending machines that will also be featured in the show.</p><p>The design of a vending machine lends itself to collaborative efforts within an art context as it is often a central source for various products. There will be various formats of vending machine, from <b>gumball dispensers</b> to <b>soda machines</b>. These will determine the possible size and weight of the artworks.</p><h4 id="Submit">Submit</h4><p>Please submit a one-page proposal with a detailed description and any additional reference material to:</p><h4 style="text-align: center"><a href="mailto:submissions@artarcade.net?Subject=Proposal"><b>submissions@artarcade.net</b></a></h4></div></div><div class="footer"><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></span> from the Art Arcade Collective</p></div></div><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
